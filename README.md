ExcelToAccess
=============

A java program that transfers Excel data into an MS Access Database. (I've used MS Access 2007)
You are free to use this code in any of your applications, but please remember to give credit where credit is due. :)

I've attached seven files:

(1) An MS Office file where you can find all the instructions you'll need to run this program
(2/3/4) Java Files with full comments. (Hopefully, since I tried to cover every detail, you will have no trouble
        understanding the code.)
(5) A license from me
(6) An excel sheet, just to give you an idea about what I worked on
(7) My entire project folder consisting of all the files I was using with Eclipse.

I hope this helps you in your works.

Good Luck!
