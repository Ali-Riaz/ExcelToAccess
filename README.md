ExcelToAccess
=============

A java program that transfers Excel data into an MS Access Database. (I've used MS Access 2007)
You are free to use this code in any of your applications, but please remember to give credit where credit is due. :)

I've attached four files:

(1) An MS Office file where you can find all the instructions you'll need to run this program
(2/3/4) Java Files with full comments. (Hopefully, since I tried to cover every detail, you will have no trouble
        understanding the code.)

I hope this helps you in your works.

Good Luck!
